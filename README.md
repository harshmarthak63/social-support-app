## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v16 or higher)
- npm or yarn
- OpenAI API key (optional, for OpenAI assistance)
- Mistral AI API key (optional, for Mistral assistance)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd social-support-app
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash

```

3. Create a `.env` file in the root directory:
```env
VITE_OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
VITE_MISTRAL_API_KEY=your_mistral_api_key_here
```

**Note**: Both API keys are optional. The application will work without them, but AI assistance features will be unavailable.

4. Start the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

The application will open at `http://localhost:3000` (or the port shown in the terminal).

### Building for Production

## Form Steps

### Step 1: Personal Information
- Name, National ID, Date of Birth, Gender
- Address, City, State, Country
- Phone Number, Email Address

### Step 2: Family & Financial Information
- Marital Status, Number of Dependents
- Employment Status, Monthly Income
- Housing Status

### Step 3: Situation Descriptions
- Current Financial Situation (with AI assistance)
- Employment Circumstances (with AI assistance)
- Reason for Applying (with AI assistance)

## AI Integration

The application supports two AI providers:

### OpenAI GPT-3.5-turbo
- Click the purple "Help Me Write" button (✨ icon) to generate suggestions using OpenAI
- Uses GPT-3.5-turbo model for text generation
- Requires `VITE_OPENAI_API_KEY` in `.env` file

### Mistral AI
- Click the orange "Help Me Write" button (🧠 icon) to generate suggestions using Mistral AI
- Uses mistral-small model for text generation
- Requires `VITE_MISTRAL_API_KEY` in `.env` file

### How It Works
1. Click the AI assistance button next to any textarea field in Step 3
2. The AI considers context from other form fields (employment status, income, housing, marital status, dependents)
3. A modal opens with the AI-generated suggestion
4. Review and edit the suggestion as needed
5. Click "Accept" to add it to the form field, or "Discard" to close without saving

## Language Support

The application fully supports English and Arabic:

- **English (LTR)**: Default language with left-to-right layout
- **Arabic (RTL)**: Right-to-left layout with proper text direction
- **Language Switcher**: Click the language icon in the header to toggle between languages
- **Persistent**: Language preference is maintained during the session

## Form Submission

The application includes a mock API service for testing form submission:

- **Mock API**: Simulates network delay (1-2 seconds) and returns a success response
- **Loading State**: Shows a loading mask during submission
- **Success Feedback**: Displays application ID and status after successful submission
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling for network issues, timeouts, and server errors
- **Form Reset**: Automatically resets the form after successful submission

To use a real API, update `src/services/apiService.js` and replace `submitApplicationMock` with `submitApplication`.

## Accessibility

- **ARIA Labels**: All interactive elements have proper ARIA labels
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Full keyboard support for form navigation
- **Screen Reader Support**: Compatible with screen readers
- **Focus Indicators**: Clear focus indicators for keyboard users
- **Semantic HTML**: Proper use of semantic HTML elements
- **Color Contrast**: WCAG compliant color contrast ratios

## Browser Support

- Chrome (latest)
- Firefox (latest)
- Safari (latest)
- Edge (latest)

## Development

### Available Scripts

- `npm run dev` - Start development server
- `npm run build` - Build for production

### State Management

The application uses Redux Toolkit for state management:

- **Form State** (`formSlice`): Manages form data across all steps
- **UI State** (`uiSlice`): Manages loading states, AI modal, language, and submission status

### Local Storage

Form progress is automatically saved to local storage. The form data is cleared:
- On page reload (fresh start)
- After successful submission

## Error Handling

The application includes comprehensive error handling for:

- **API Errors**: Invalid API keys, rate limits, server errors
- **Network Errors**: Connection issues, timeouts
- **Validation Errors**: Form field validation with user-friendly messages
- **User Feedback**: Clear error messages displayed to users
